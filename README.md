# Remote Kitchen Assignment

**1.** First I used to try to understand the problem through their discussions. Then I used to name it according to that problem. As I think the problem is a homepage responsive issue then I would name the branch as `homepage-responsive-hotfix`. Then `add > commit > git push --set-upstream origin homepage-responsive-hotfix`. Then  just simple do `PR` with tick(âœ…) in `Marge after delete branch` and assign to reviewer.
